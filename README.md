# Advent of Code 2018

This is my very first AoC repository and attempt to solve all of the puzzle in the event.

The solutions are written in PHP.

## Installion

Some of the solutions depends on third-party libraries. To install them run `composer install`.

## Usage

You can run each days `index.php` independently to get the answers by running `php index.php`.

## CLI interface

I've created a little CLI interface which can run the selected days solution for you. To use it run `php runner.php`.

## Be aware!

Some solutions are need optimization. These solutions need more time to find the solution:

* Day 5
* Day 6
* Day 9 - Part 2 is not working in PHP
* Day 10
* Day 11
